            <h3>1. What types of helmets does Helmetic offer?</h3>
            <p>Helmetic offers three main helmet types, being racing, rally and karting. These are distinct from each other either
            because of safety rating or general looks. Within these categories we offer a diverse range of products. We offer a
            wide range of Bell, Arai and Stilo helmets for our racing category. The rally category consists of MAG and HP helmets
            whilst the karting helmets consist of Bell and OMP's. We're constantly looking to widen our range of helmets
            to give you the most choice available.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>2. Can I send you my helmet to get it painted?</h3>
            <p>If you've already bought a helmet or a certain helmet you're looking for isn't available we can still offer
            you a unique customization experience. Simply contact us via email or phone and we'll be happy to work on a helmet
            design for you.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>3. How long will it take for me to receive my helmet?</h3>
            <p>When your order is being processed we will try to keep you as up to date as possible concerning the delivery date.
            This will naturally depend on the type of customization you have chosen. Since we at Helmetic pride ourselves
            in hand painting every helmet to give you the best possible results, elaborate helmet designs can take up to four weeks.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>4. How do I know which helmet size I should order?</h3>
            <p>Helmet size is one of the most important things to consider when looking for a helmet. A badly fitted helmet can
            cause discomfort and most of all can lead to unsafe situations when the helmet is unable to be fastened well.
            We at Helmetic offer a size chart which you can find on the Personalization page. If you have a hard time figuring out
            you correct size, we're more than happy to assist you. Simply contact us via email of telephone.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>5. Is it possible to return a customized helmet?</h3>
            <p>Unfortunately due to the nature of a customized helmet and it being very individual, it is not possible for you
            to return the product. This does not include situations in which your helmet fit is incorrect, or you feel like we
            have not done a good enough job painting the helmet. Non-customized product you can return within 14 days of purchase.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>6. What is the best way to clean my helmet?</h3>
            <p>No special equipment is needed to optimally clean your helmet exterior and visor apart from some warm water and soap.
            Use a soft, non-abrasive rag to clean the exterior and use Q-tips to remove and leftover dirt which the rag couldn't reach.
            Don't use heat to dry the helmet as this can shorten paint's lifespan, simply use a towel and let the rest air dry.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>7. When should I replace my helmet?</h3>
            <p>Even the best materials degrade over time, and the high-performance, lightweight materials currently in use are no exception.
            Racing safety agencies recommend a helmet replacement after 5 years of use, or immediately after any incident. Only every use
            a helmet that is in top condition, if you have any doubts, replace it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>8. Can I obtain replacement parts for my helmet?</h3>
            <p>Some small parts of the helmets can be replaced without cost. If you're in need of replacement of bigger parts such as
            the visor then contact us.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>9. How do I store my helmet?</h3>
            <p>After each use, allow the helmet to air dry before storing it in a cool, dry place. Avoid storing it in a place that
                is either very hot or very cold as these extreme condition can cause the helmet materials to degrade faster than they're supposed to.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>10. What do I do if my helmet has been in an incident?</h3>
            <p>After you have been in an incident it is instrumental to fully examine the helmet for any damage. If you are unsure about any damage of internal parts
                you can send us the helmet and we will perform the inspection free of charge. Remember that when your helmet has any form of damage
                it is imperative you replace it.</p>
